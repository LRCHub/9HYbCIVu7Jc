Getting money every day, it's not stopping me
I fucked a lot of hoes
But it ain't no loyalty, loyalty
Money got me thinkin', that there's more than me
You got to honor me, loyalty
Playing in the streets then you can start to be
We got all these fuckin' girls
Ain't no more than me

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Everybody got a hole in their ass
Thinkin' you gonna burry me
Everywhere I go I see purple dicks
It's kind of disturbing me
I steal with my niggas
Ain't shit changed but the money and the days of the week
I'm still with my niggas boy you know this 'til the death of me
With money comes power, these bitches know the recipe

Niggas are falling
They think these guys are helping me
These niggas starvin'
And there is no loyalty

Niggas are fuck boy ain't no loyalty, loyalty
Can't trust a bum bitch no ain't no loyalty, loyalty
I got from my respect boy I need royalties, loyalty
Niggas ain't my homies that owe me, they are part of me

I'm a small dick nigga so ain't no
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Niggas are fuck boy ain't no loyalty, loyalty
Can't trust a bum bitch no ain't no loyalty, loyalty
I got from my respect boy I need royalties, loyalty
